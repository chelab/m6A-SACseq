**m<sup>6</sup>A selective allyl chemical labeling and sequencing (m<sup>6</sup>A-SAC-seq) for base-resolution m<sup>6</sup>A analysis**

Strategy — The very similar chemical feature of m<sup>6</sup>A and A makes it challenging to differentiate the methylated versus the unmodified base in RNA.
For instance, unlike modifications such as m<sup>1</sup>A, m<sup>3</sup>C, m<sup>1</sup>G and m<sup>2</sup><sub>2</sub>G, which occur at the Watson–Crick face of the nucleobases and could induce mutations or stops upon reverse transcription (RT), m<sup>6</sup>A shows a minor effect on Watson-Crick base pairing.
The modification information will be lost upon RT followed by amplification.
The inert chemical property of the methyl group on m<sup>6</sup>A so far precludes chemistry-based selective labeling of m<sup>6</sup>A versus A.
We thus envisioned selective enzymatic reactions that could preferentially label or modulate either m<sup>6</sup>A or A. Ideally, our reaction preferentially labels m<sup>6</sup>A instead of A because A is ~200-fold more abundant than m<sup>6</sup>A in mammalian mRNA.
A reaction that specifically modulates A over m<sup>6</sup>A would need to be extremely efficient and selective in order to quantitatively detect 0.4-0.6% of m<sup>6</sup>A in RNA.
Based on these considerations we have invented m<sup>6</sup>A **S**elective **A**llyl **C**hemical labeling and sequencing (m<sup>6</sup>A-SAC-seq), a quantitative method for whole-transcriptome mapping of m<sup>6</sup>A at single-nucleotide resolution.
